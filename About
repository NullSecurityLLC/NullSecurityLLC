# NullSecurityLLC

Welcome to **NullSecurity**, where security isn't a service — it's a philosophy. We're not here to play catch-up with threats. We're here to **nullify them**.

## Who We Are

We're a high-intensity, high-integrity cybersecurity group specializing in:

- OSINT Investigations  
- Penetration Testing  
- Security Education & Awareness  
- Live Cyber Ranges & Air-Gapped Labs  
- Secure Operating System Development (NullOS)  
- Experimental Tech & Custom Tooling  
- Real-World Missing Person Investigations

Whether it's hardening networks, building sandboxed environments, or diving into raw digital forensics — we live and breathe cyber.

## Current Projects

### NullOS
A hardened, compartmentalized cybersecurity OS built for OSINT, pentesting, and operational security. Two versions:
- Open-Source Edition for the community
- Internal Edition with self-destruct features & advanced counter-intrusion logic

### ArkAngel
Our moonshot AI-powered OSINT system for finding missing persons — think *Person of Interest*, but real.

### NullSec Cyber Range
An air-gapped physical facility for practicing DDoS, reverse engineering, digital forensics, and more — includes physical e-waste labs and open lab days.

## Education & Training

- Hosting cybersecurity assemblies in local schools  
- Training law enforcement on real-world digital threats  

## Our Ethos

We don't follow trends. We hunt them down.  
We build. We break. We learn.  
And when the world goes dark... we stay online.
